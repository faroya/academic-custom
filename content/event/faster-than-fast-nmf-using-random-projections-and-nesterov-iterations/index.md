title: Randomized NMF with Nesterov Iterations
abstract: Random projections have been recently implemented in Nonnegative
  Matrix Factorization (NMF) to speed-up the NMF computations, with a negligible
  loss of performance. In this paper, we investigate the effects of such
  projections when the NMF technique uses the fast Nesterov gradient descent
  (NeNMF). We experimentally show the randomized subspace iteration to
  significantly speed-up NeNMF.
