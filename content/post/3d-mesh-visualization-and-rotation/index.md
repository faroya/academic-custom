title: 3D Mesh Visualization and Rotation
date: 2023-09-07T21:01:57.306Z
summary: This project uses the Open3D library to visualize and manipulate 3D
  mesh data. A 3D mesh is loaded and rotated to create a 360-degree animation
  over 10 frames. Each frame is captured as an image and saved in a compatible
  format, facilitating the detailed analysis or presentation of 3D models from
  various angles.

## Requirements

* Open3D
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* PIL
* IPython

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

## Usage

1. Update the `wildtype_image_path` variable in the script to the path of your `.ply` file.
2. Run the script:

The script will visualize the 3D mesh, rotate it, and save the resulting frames as images in the `output_frames` folder.

## Details

The script uses the Open3D library to read a 3D mesh from a `.ply` file and visualize it. It then rotates the mesh and captures the frames of the rotation, saving them as images.

The script first reads the 3D mesh from the specified `.ply` file and computes its vertex normals. It then initializes the Open3D visualizer and sets up the parameters for the rotation and frame saving.

The script then enters a loop where it rotates the mesh by a small amount, adds it to the visualizer, captures the current visualization as an image, converts the image to an OpenCV-compatible format, and saves the image as a `.png` file in the `output_frames` folder.

The script rotates the mesh 360 degrees over the specified number of frames and saves each frame as an image.

```python
import open3d as o3d
import numpy as np
import cv2
import os

wildtype_image_path = "images/Wildtype63D.ply"
mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh(wildtype_image_path)
mesh.compute_vertex_normals()


# we can display the image as a point cloud
# pcd_WildType = mesh.sample_points_uniformly(number_of_points=500)
# o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd_WildType])


# Define parameters for frame saving
output_frames_folder = "output_frames"
os.makedirs(output_frames_folder, exist_ok=True)
num_frames = 10  # Number of frames
rotation_degrees_per_frame = 360 / num_frames  # Rotate 360 degrees over the frames

# Initialize Open3D visualizer
vis = o3d.visualization.Visualizer()
vis.create_window()

# Save the frames as images
for frame_idx in range(num_frames):
    # Clear the visualizer and add the mesh at the current rotation
    vis.clear_geometries()
    mesh.rotate(mesh.get_rotation_matrix_from_xyz((0, np.radians(rotation_degrees_per_frame * frame_idx), 0)))
    vis.add_geometry(mesh)

    # Capture the current visualization as an image
    vis.poll_events()
    vis.update_renderer()
    color_image = vis.capture_screen_float_buffer()

    # Convert the Open3D image to an OpenCV-compatible format
    color_image_cv = np.array(color_image)
    color_image_cv = cv2.cvtColor((color_image_cv * 255).astype(np.uint8), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)  # OpenCV uses BGR format

    # Save the frame as an image
    frame_filename = os.path.join(output_frames_folder, f"frame_{frame_idx:03d}.png")
    cv2.imwrite(frame_filename, color_image_cv)

# Release the visualizer
vis.destroy_window()
```
