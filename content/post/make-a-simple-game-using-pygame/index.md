date: 2023-09-13T07:31:48.771Z
summary: This project is a simple Python game where a player controls a rabbit
  to catch falling carrots, with the score increasing for each catch. Developed
  using the Pygame library, it features basic graphics, sound effects, and
  utilizes collision detection for gameplay mechanics. The game runs
  continuously until the player opts to close the window.

# Rabbit Pygame Project

In this project, I have implemented a simple game using the Pygame library where a rabbit tries to catch falling carrots. Each time a carrot is caught, the score increases. Here are the details of the project.

## Dependencies

- Pygame: Used for game development, managing assets like images and sounds, and handling events.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script which contains the game logic.
- `models.py`: This script should contain the definitions for `Carrot` and `Rabbit` classes (not provided here).
- `art/bg.png`: Background image file.
- `eat.wav`: Sound file which plays when a carrot is caught.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` script.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Code Structure

### Importing Necessary Modules

```python
import pygame
from models import *
```

### Initializing Pygame and Variables

We initialize Pygame and necessary variables including the screen dimensions and FPS.

```python
pygame.init()
pygame.mixer.init()
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
Fps = 30
screen_w = 580
screen_h = 620
```

### Loading Assets

Loading necessary assets like background image and eating sound.

```python
bg = pygame.image.load("art/bg.png").convert_alpha()
bg = pygame.transform.scale(bg, (screen_w, screen_h))
eat = pygame.mixer.Sound("eat.wav")
```

### Creating Rabbit and Carrots

Initializing the rabbit and carrots objects. The carrots are created in a list with randomized positions.

```python
rect1, rabbit = Rabbit(300, screen_h - 135)
carrots = []
for carrot in range(4):
    carrots.append(Carrot(random.randint(20, screen_w-20), random.randint(-50, -10)))
```

### Main Game Loop

Within the main game loop, we perform several actions including checking for events, handling collision detection, and updating the positions of carrots and rabbit.

```python
while run:
    # ... (rest of the loop)
```

### Drawing the Scene

Within the main loop, we have a section where we draw the carrots, rabbit, and the score onto the window.

```python
win.blit(rabbit, (rect1.x, rect1.y))
text = font.render(str(score), 1, (255, 255, 255))
win.blit(text, (screen_w/2.1, 20))
pygame.display.update()
win.blit(bg, (0, 0))
```

## Conclusion

This is a simple Pygame project to showcase the creation of a game with basic collision detection and scorekeeping. You can further expand this project by adding more features and refining the existing ones.
