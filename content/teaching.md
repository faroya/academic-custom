> ***Semester 2***

**Algorithms 2 *( C++ )*** 

*variable, arrays, functions (printf, scanf, ..), control structures (conditional, loops), functions (passing parameters by value), Pointers, definition, functions: passing parameters by reference and tables: static/dynamic*

**Algorithms 3 *( Advanced C++ )***  
*recursion, N-dimensional arrays, stacks, files (concepts, methods), linked lists, and finally a project.*

**Database 1** *Taught with A. Ahmad (ULCO/LISIC)*
