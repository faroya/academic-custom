***Semester 1***

> **Advanced Algorithms**    *3 ECTS*  
> Computational thinking, modeling, reformulation, complexity, reduction, NP-completeness, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greedy algorithm, branch and bound, and flow algorithms

> **Synthesis Project**     *2 ECTS*.   
> Project related to the research themes of LISIC: bibliographic synthesis, study of solutions, and writing a research article 

> **Algorithms 1**    *3 ECTS*.   
> Basic concepts (variable, function, conditional, iteration, and array) and Python

> **Web 1**  *3 ECTS*.    
> Architecture of a web page, foundational language (HTML) and stylesheet language (CSS)

***Semester 2***

> **Algorithms 2 (C++)**    *3 ECTS*.    
> Variable, arrays, functions (printf, scanf, ..), control structures (conditional, loops), functions (passing parameters by value), pointers, definition, functions: passing parameters by reference and tables: static/dynamic

> **Algorithms 3 (Advanced C++)**  *3 ECTS*.   
> Recursion, N-dimensional arrays, stacks, files (concepts, methods), linked lists, and finally a project.

> **Database 1**  *3 ECTS*  *Taught with A. Ahmad (ULCO/LISIC)*.  
> Information System Modeling, UML formalism, Conceptual Data Model (CDM), Relational Data Logical Model (RDLM), Transition rules from CDM to RDLM (Functional dependencies, normal forms 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

> **Digital Tools (DU Tremplin)**  *3 ECTS*.   
> To prevent mid-course dropouts, the university offers a module where students are taught essential digital skills including text processing, slide creation, and Excel usage, preparing them for pix.fr certification exams.




 **2020 --- 2021**
